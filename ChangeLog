V5.27
---------
 * Bumped the version to 5.27 and imported useful changes from breeze-5.27.2.
 * Removed the option about drawing border on maximized and tiled windows (it was both ugly and confusing).
 * Removed the 1-pix empty gap below shaded windows.
 * Smaller shadow for inactive windows (without any shadow animation).
 * Removed the activation state animation. It was redundant and wasn't consistent with Qt's activation state (which Kvantum supports).

 V5.26
---------
 * Bumped the version to 5.26 without any change.

V5.25
---------
 * Enabled the new decoration blurring of KWin (without "blur glitches").

V5.22
---------
 * Bumped the version to 5.22 and imported useful changes from breeze-5.22.1.

V5.21

 * Bumped the version to 5.21 without any change (breeze-5.21.0 added shadow animation but I didn't import it to save resources).

V5.20
---------

 * Also include borders in the opacity override.

V5.13
---------
 * First version, made out of Breeze 5.13 and BreezeBlurred with new options.

 * Added flatness to the exception list.
 * Made inactive macOS-like buttons gray.
 * Added a setting for button spacing.
 * Added opacity override to the exception dialog.
